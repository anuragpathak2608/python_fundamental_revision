python both compiled and interpreted

compiled language means --> converting HHL to Low level language
or converting from one language to other language
0computer understand 0,1 or machine code
compiler converts high level code to object code, machine code or byte code.

First program get compiled >> then executed
JAVA:
Compilation: javac hello_world.java >>> create bytecode(.class file)
execution : java hello_world

compilation is done in one go and all the error(logical, sntax, symentec are raisd)
once your program is free from error compiler allow you to run the program.

compiler help or make you code interoperable (bytecode is platform independent)
every os has diffrent instrution set and bytecode is platfrom dependent

Interpreter:
line by line.
encounters error stops there
further code will not get executed.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Python is both compiled and interpreted language.
is HLL
code is first complied and the executed by interpreter.

when you create user defined modules, and you import these into .py file
for very first time when will you execute your code the .pyc file will get
created which contains compiled code.

from next time the compliled code is used to save the time


.PY
Contains soruce code

.PYC
contains compiled code

---------------------------------------------------------------
python is a language ; uses PVM(python virtual machine)
and it is implemented in diffrent forms such as

CPython : base is C(most widely used python)
Jython : base is java
pypy:
inronPython : Dot Net version()
